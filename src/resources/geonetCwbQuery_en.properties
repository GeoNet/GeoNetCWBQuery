usage=java -jar GeoNetCWBQuery.jar [-f filename][ -b date_time -s NSCL -d duration] -t [ms | msz | sac(def) | text] [-o filemask]\n \
    e.g.  java -jar GeoNetCWBQuery.jar -s \"IIAAK  LHZ00\" -b \"2007/05/06 21:11:52\" -d 3600 -t sac -o %N_%y_%j\n \
    OR    java -jar GeoNetCWBQuery.jar -f my_batch_file\n \
 Directory/Holdings:\n \
    -ls  List the data files available for queries (not generally useful to users)\n \
    -lsc List every channel its days of availability from begin time through duration (default last 15 days)\n \
         Use the -b and -d options to set limits on time interval of the channel list \n \
         This option can be cpu intensive if you ask for a long interval, so use only as needed.\n \
 Query Modes of operation :\n \
   Line mode (command line mode) do not use -f and include -s NSCL -b yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss -d secs on line\n \
   File mode or batch mode:\n \
     Create a file with one line per query with lines like [QUERY SWITCHES][OUTPUT SWITCHES]:\n \
       example line :   '-s NSCL -b yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss[.SSS] -d duration -t sac -o %N_%y_%j'\n \
     Then run CWB Query with  '-f filename' filename with list of SNCL start times and durations\n \
 Query Switches (station and time interval limits) :\n \
    -s NSCL or REGEXP  (note: on many shells its best to put this argument in double quotes)\n \
       NNSSSSSCCCLL to specify a seed channel name. If < 12 characters, match any seednames starting\n \
           with those characters.  Example : '-s IUA' would return all IU stations starting with 'A' (ADK,AFI,ANMO,ANTO) \n \
       OR \n \
       REGEXP :'.' matches any character, [ABC] means one character which is A, or B or C The regexp is right padded with '.'\n \
           Example: '-s IUANMO.LH[ZN]..' returns the vertical and north component for LH channels at station(s) starting with 'ANMO'\n \
           '.*' matchs zero or more following characters (include in quotes as * has many meanings!\n \
           'AA|BB' means matches pattern AA or BB e.g.  'US.*|IU.*' matches the US and IU networks\n \
    -b begin time yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss[.SSS] (normally enclose in quotes) or yyyy,doy-hh:mm:ss[.SSS]\n \
    -d nnnn[d] seconds of duration(default is 300 seconds) end with 'd' to indicate nnnn is in days\n \
    -offset nnnn.nn seconds of offset (default is no offset) relative to begin time request data from\n \
    -sacpz nm|um Request sac style response files in either nanometers (nm) or micrometers(um)\n \
    \n \
    -event quakeml_ref a fully qulified http or file uri (or geonet: qualified public ID) reference to a quakeML\n \
       event description. This option can be used by itself (in place of -b and -s) to request event data\n \
       with begin set to the quakeML origin time, for all channels in the quakeML with associated picks.\n \
       Examples are: "http://app-beta.geonet.org.nz/ws-quake-2.2.0-RC1/quakeml/1.0.1/ref/3134964"\n \
           or "file:///tmp/3134964.qml" or "geonet:3134964" as a shortcut to GeoNet quakeML\n \
     OR, alternatively custom event parameters can be defined using qualified event options:\n \
    -event:time yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss[.SSS] or yyyy,doy-hh:mm:ss[.SSS] - will also set the begin time if none is given.\n \
    -event:lat nnn.nn event latitude\n \
    -event:lon nnn.nn event longitude\n \
    -event:depth nnn.nn event depth (km)\n \
    -event:mag nn.nnn event magnitude\n \
    -event:magtype [MB|MS|ML|MW|MD|MX] event magnitude type (default is MX)\n \
    -event:type SAC_EVENT_TYPE event type e.g. EARTHQUAKE, LANDSLIDE, SONICBOOM (default is NULL)\n \
    \n \
 Output Controls : \n \
    -q Run in quiet mode (No progress or file status reporting)\n \
    \n \
    -t [ms | msz | sac | dcc | dcc512 | text | NULL] output type.  \n \
        ms is raw blocks with gaps/overlaps (ext='.ms')\n \
        msz = is data output as continuous mini-seed with filling use -fill to set other fill values (ext='.msz')\n \
              can also be output as gappy miniseed with -msgaps NOTE: msz rounds times to nearest millsecond\n \
        sac = is Seismic Analysis Code format (see -fill for info on nodata code) (ext='.sac')\n \
        dcc = best effort reconciliation to 4096 byte mini-seed form.  Overlaps are eliminated. (ext='.msd'\n \
        dcc512 = best effort reconciliation to 512 byte mini-seed form.  Overlaps are eliminated. (ext='.msd'\n \
        text = simple text format with space separated values, one row per sample: 'Epoch milliseconds' 'value'\n \
               This can be extremely verbose. \
        NULL = do not create data file, return blocks to caller (for use from a user program)\n \
        \n \
    -o mask Put the output in the given filename described by the mask/tokens (Default : %N\n \
       Tokens: (Any non-tokens will be literally in the file name)\n \
         %N the whole seedname NNSSSSSCCCLL\n \
         %n the two letter SEED network          %s the 5 character SEED station code\n \
         %c the 3 character SEED channel         %l the two character location\n \
         %y Year as 4 digits                     %Y 2 character Year\n \
         %j Day of year (1-366)                  %J Julian day (since 1572)\n \
         %M 2 digit month                        %D 2 digit day of month\n \
         %h 2 digit hour                         %m 2 digit minute\n \
         %S 2 digit second                       %z zap all underscores from name\n \

     -msb nnnn Set mini-seed block size to nnnn (512 and 4096 only)\n \
     -msgaps Process the data and have gaps in the output miniseed rather than filled values\n \

     \n \
   TEXT options :\n \
     -fill nnnnnn use nnnnnn as the fill value instead of the default Integer.MIN_VALUE (the minimum integer value for the system the client is run on).\n \
     -nogaps if present, any missing data in the interval except at the end results in no output file. A -sactrim is also done\n \
